1) Build the file <main - closed loop test harness - single precision.cpp> and generate an executable
2) Run the executable in the same directory as the ATT, GPS, IMU, MAG, NTUN and timing.txt files
3) It should generate the following output files (outputs have been provided for reference)

	CovDataOut.txt
	EulDataOut.txt
	MagFuse.txt
	RefVelPosDataOut.txt
	StateDataOut.txt
	TasFuse.txt
	VelPosFuse.txt
	
4) These can be plotted in Matlab using the PlotCcodeOutput.m script files

Author: Paul Riseborough

You will need Matlab + Simulink 2012a or later to run this model

Instructions to run:

1) Add models, plots, scripts and TestData directories to your Matlab path
2) Make models your working directory
3) Run the RunNavFilterTestHarness.m script file
4) Test data will be loaded and the model will be built, run and plots generated.

You can load other test data by modifying the file load command at the top of the LoadNavFilterTestData.m script file.
